<h1>Procedure of Support</h1>

<p><span>Listed below are methods taken by our phpFox Support Staff when issues arise and the clients need technical help to solve it.</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check if server meets all the requirements found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phpfox.com/faq/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check if any of the default files have been modified. If any of the files have been modified client must&nbsp;<strong>backup</strong>&nbsp;their site and upload the default phpFox files.</li>
  <li>Check to make sure all the files/folders are in place and all permissions are set correctly to each of the folders.</li>
  <li>Compare issues with our live demo found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phpfox.com/demo/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Turn on PHP "error reporting".</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If the above steps do not help solve the case for the client, then the case is sent to the developers for further attention.</span></p>

<h1>Multiple Support Tickets</h1>
<p>Our support coverage can only cover 1 support ticket and one issue at a time. If you have multiple issues we can look over each issue 1 issue at a time via 1 support ticket. Once an issue has been resolved we will close that ticket so you can submit a new ticket.</p>
