    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
         Welcome to our store. Everything added to our store is first reviewed by our team, before it is approved, for installing and uninstalling functions. We do not test for feature functionality or other issues at this time.

	<h1>Policy and Terms</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Products sold in our Store are developed and maintained by 3rd party companies and developers. </li>
		<li>We take no legal or technical liability for products sold in our Store. </li>
		<li>We do not support the products provided by said parties or their services. For support and assistance regarding the 3rd party products please contact the provider.</li>

	<h1>Payments and Refunds</h1>
	<p>Payments go directly to developer's Paypal account. Refunds for purchases made within our Store are at the developer's sole discretion. Please be sure to read over product reviews and ask any questions to the provider beforehand and read the developer's terms on their website.</p>

	<h1>Information Shared</h1>
	<p>In order to provide you with better support we share your email and the domain name to the developers of the Store products you purchase. This information is not shared to any 3rd party other than the developers of the products you purchase.</p>

	<h1>Complaints</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>If a product does not work as described and as the demo shows, you can submit a complaint to our sales desk in a support ticket via your client account area.</li>
		<li>Complaints must be accompanied by a link to the product and you must have reviewed the product in the case of non-functionality. Installation issues can be server related so please don't rate badly on that.</li>
		<li>If we receive complaints about products in the store, and if those products have more than 3 bad reviews, the products will be disabled for the developer to fix them. While they are disabled, you will have no access to your purchased product.</li>
		<li>We encourage you to work with the developer first, before submitting bad reviews or complaints. In the event that you should be unable to work with the developer and find it necessary to submit a complaint, we will attempt to mediate but cannot promise results as each developer has control over how they provide support and assistance. Our only responsibility is to disable a product, or in the event of many complaints, a developer's account.</li>
	</ul>
