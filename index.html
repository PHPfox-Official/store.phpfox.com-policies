	<h1>Reviews</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Reviews must be in English</li>
		<li>Reviews are final and can only be edited if a Report is sent by the client that posted it. Edits will only be considered for mistakes on the review, a bad review based on a phpFox bug, or extenuating circumstances.</li>
		<li>Reviews cannot be changed simply because you changed your mind. Please be sure to fully test a product before reviewing it.</li>
		<li>We encourage you to work with the developer first, before submitting bad reviews. In the event that you should be unable to work with the developer, you can seek a refund via Paypal.</li>
		<li>Reviews are not to be used in exchange for free work or free apps. Should we find that clients or developers are blackmailing for reviews, access to the store can be revoked and all reviews removed.</li>
