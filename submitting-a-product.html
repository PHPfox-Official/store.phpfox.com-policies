    <h1>Submitting a product to our Store</h1>
    <p>
        All the products that are added to our Store are first approved by us before it goes public. We also do weekly checks on products to make sure they meet our stores requirements. When your product is denied, don't worry, you can look over this guide to fix any issues.

    <h1>General</h1>
    <p>
        This is where you can add your <b>Products Name</b>, <b>Category</b> and <b>Version</b>. When you adding your <b>products name</b>, try to keep it short and to the point. Give your product a unique name that is also relevant to what it does. Names that overextend and use keywords to explain what it is will not be approved.
