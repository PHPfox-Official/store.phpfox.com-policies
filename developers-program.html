# Developers Program

<article>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
         Welcome to our developer's program. Everything added to our store is first reviewed by our team before it is approved. When a product is approved to our store we do periodic checks on the functionality of a product.
    </p>

    <h1>Selling in Our Store</h1>
    <p>
        When you submit and publish your product you agree that Moxi9/phpFox can place your product within its store based on the price you define. We do not take any legal responsibility or liability for your products and simply provide a venue for you to sell and distribute it to our clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        Products cannot include links to other stores in order to purchase the same product. If you wish to sell your product on another site, that is fine, we simply do accept these links on our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Products that are copies of other developer's work (piracy) will be removed and the developer will be removed from the developer program. We fully conform to DMCA and International copyright laws and take piracy of any nature seriously.
    </p>
    <p> We do not allow our Moxi9/phpFox name, logo, avatars, or any representations of official phpFox association to be used by anyone other than our own company. Developers who use our Moxi9/phpFox name as part of their company name or website will be removed from the developer program.</p>
    <p> Developers already in our program that have phpfox in their website domain name are required to state, clearly and concisely, "Not associated with the phpFox company. Independent business." on any and all media. Should we have any issues regarding client confusion over domain names with our phpFox name in them, we will require them to be changed.</p>

    <h1>Developer Conduct</h1>
    <p>
       We expect each developer to act in a professional manner. Great care is to be taken with clients to ensure a pleasant experience for all involved. As such, the following standards and disciplinary measures will be employed:
    <ul>
        <li>Each developer will provide some form of support for paid products. The level of support and terms are up to the developer but must be stated on the developer's website (if there is one) or in the listings. Free products do not require any support but should be stated "No Support Provided" or some such statement in the product listing if you are not providing support.</li>
        <li>Each developer is required to have a means of contact either in each listing or in their profile so clients can get in touch. This can be an email or a support system link.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
